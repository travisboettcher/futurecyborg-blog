Running the application
-----------------------

If you would like to clone this repository and run it, follow the installation guide on the Phoenix Framework website [here](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/installation). Then start the app:

1. Install the dependencies with `mix deps.get`
2. Create and migrate the database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
3. Start the Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now the website should be accessible at [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000).
